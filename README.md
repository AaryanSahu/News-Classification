# News-Classification

This project aims to classify news articles into different categories using Spacy word embeddings. It compares the performance of two classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB).


The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of news articles from various sources. Each news article is labeled with a specific category, such as politics, sports, technology, etc. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set.
